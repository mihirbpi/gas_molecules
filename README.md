# gas_molecules

Gas molecules simulator that simulates the motion of ideal gas molecules in a container that follow a [Maxwell-Boltzmann velocity distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution).

Move the sliders to change the mass and temperature of the molecules. Created using the p5.js JavaScript library.
